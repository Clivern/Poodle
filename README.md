Poodle is an interactive command line tool to build and test web APIs based on a pre-built definitions.

`Poodle` has the following features:

- Register your web services and endpoints easily.
- Use variables in endpoints definitions.
- Painless debugging and interaction with APIs.
- Search web services and endpoints interactively.
- Edit services and endpoints easily (config is just a TOML file).
- Sync services via Gist automatically.
